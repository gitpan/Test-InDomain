NAME

Test::InDomain - Testing deep datastructures against data domains

DESCRIPTION

This module is a complement to L<Test::Simple> or L<Test::More> (or
any other testing module based on L<Test::Builder>). It adds the
function C<in_domain> to your panoply of testing tools; that function
uses the functionalities of L<Data::Domain> to check deep
datastructures and produce detailed reports about where the data
differs from the expectations.
